In this video, I'm going to be showing you how to make a website with Python, covering Flask, authentication, databases, and more. The goal of this video is to give you what you need to make a finished product that you can tweak, and turn into anything you like. We're going to also go over how you create a new user's account, how you store those in a database, how to log into those user accounts, how to log out of them, and how you associate that information with a specific user. 



# Step 0. below should be executed in your local anaconda prompt window
# Step 1. initiate a new environment called bdcheck to avoid messing up with package versions in your base env

conda activate note_app
# Step 3. go to the designated directory
cd "C:\Users\shuai\Documents\allProjects\Lab\Note App\Note App"
